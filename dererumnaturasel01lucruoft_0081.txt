LUCRETIUS V

Libra. The daily revolution then coincides with the Equator,
resulting in days and nights of equal length.

The Solstices or Tropics (so-called because the sun seems to
stand still and to turn back), l. 617, are the points in the Ecliptic
when the sun is furthest from the Equator, June 22 in the sign of
Cancer (l. 617) when we have the longest day, December 21 in
Capricorn (1. 615) when we have the longest night, the greater half
of the Ecliptic being above and below the Equator in turn, resulting
respectively in the longest day and longest night.

The Zodiac (so-called from the animals ζῴδια, after which the
twelve signs are named, l. 691) is a narrow belt of sky on each side
of the Ecliptic; it is divided into twelve equal parts, six north, six
south of the Equator. The system was evolved in Babylon at least
as early as 2000 Β. C.

 

ECLIPSE OF THE SUN (ll. 753-5).

. The Moon passing on her orbit between the Sun and the Earth
intercepts the light of the Sun and causes a solar Eclipse. If the
Moon travelled in the plane of the Ecliptic there would be a solar
Eclipse whenever there was a new moon.

 

ECLIPSE oF THE MooN (ll. 762-4).

The Moon passes through the Zodiac once a month. Her orbit
is slightly inclined to the Ecliptic3 if it coincided with it the Moon
would pass between the Earth and the Sun, causing an Eclipse
every month. The Penumbra is the com· umbras, 1. 764.
