LUCRETIUS v. 2 58—72

alid: the object.
alid: archaic for aliud: as in ll. 1305, 1456.

258. redditur, (1) ‘is put back '‚ i. e. is ultimately replaced some-
where 3 (2) ‘is replenished’‚‘ has restitution made to it ’ : the use of
the word is here almost like the Greek middle voice. For the
sentiment cf. ll. 322—3.

procul dubio: as in iii. 638 = sine dubio.
videtur, ‘ is found‚' passive.

259. omniparens: subst. ‘all-mother earth’3 take eadem pre-
dicatively‚ ‘at the same time.’ For the sentiment Munro quotes
Orell. Inscr. mater genuit, mater recepit. Eurip. Ant. fr. 195
ἐτι-αντα τίκτει χθὼν πάλιν τε λαμβάνει. Shakespeare, Romeo and

ulia, ΙΙ. iii:
The earth that’s nature's mother is her tomb:
What is her burying grave, that is her womb.
260. tibi: ethic dative. So too in 1. 294 and nobis l. 1209.
lffiatur, lit. ⁴ has something (a taste) taken from it ⁹, and con-
sequently ‘ is lessened ' : cf. l. 568.

261. quod. superest: see 1. 251. Notice the asyndeton. When
all the subst. contain the same idea, the harshness of the asyndeton
is not so marked.

262. latices: probably subject to manare. Duff suggests that
it may be internal accus. See L. ἃ S. mano I. A. β.

263. nil opus est verbis: sc. declarare from declarat in the
next line.

264. aquai: partitive genit., archaic form.

quicquid for quicque: see 1. 131. The phrase = τὸ ἀεὶ πρῶτον
ὕδωρ : cf. ll. 284, 304 ; each part successively, one after another. Cf.
l. 291.
265. tollitur . . .‚ ‘is taken off and so, on the whole, there is no
overflow.'
nil: adv. acc.
266. Strong v alliteration.
verrentes . . . sol: recurs ll. 388-9.

267. retexens, ⁶ decomposing ἐ lit. ‘ undoing its fabric!

268. Notice the juxtaposition of preposition and adverb.

269—72. Almost as in vi. 635-8.

virus: the strong, undrinkable brine of the sea.
remanat: peculiar to Lucretius.

270. materies. Lucretius has also avarities, natales, amicitiem.

271. dulci: sweet‚ fresh water, without the nauseating taste of
the briny sea water.

agmine: so too of streams in Ennius and Vergil. Cf. Milton,
paradise Lost, vii. 305
‘W'here rivers now Stream and perpetual draw their humid train.'

272. via secta semel, ‘ a channel once scooped.’

pede: of a stream. So Hor. Epod. xvi. 48 levis crepante
lynzplm desilit pede. Verg. Cal. 17 liquido pede labitur mula.
Duff: ‘We speak ofa stream running, but we can hardly speak of
its ‘⁶ foot ’'‚ though Jeremy Taylor could?
