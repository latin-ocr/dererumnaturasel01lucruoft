INTRODUCTION

could only cause them anxiety: their bliss being perfect and
divine could not be increased. Besides the very imperfectioris
of the world disprove divine agency. The creation of the
world is due to chance or nature, practically synonymous terms
in the Epicurean philosophy.

In Ethics Epicurus agreed with Aristippus in making pleasure
the sole natural end of life, the standard of good, as sensa-
tionis of truth: pain is the sole evil: pleasure is the absence
of pain. On the other hand mental pleasures which give
permanent tranquillity are to be preferred to bodily pleasures
which provide merely momentary gratification. To ensure
freedom from pain he taught the value of plain living, seeing
in virtue not the end of life, but rather the means to the end
of life, which offered to him a state of temperate equilibrium
and pleasant tranquillity‚ both mental and physical (ἀταραξία).
The wise man, that is the virtuous man, is happy and has this
mental and physical ἀταραξία because he is free from the sear
of the gods and of death, he can control his passions and
desires, and can distinguish accurately between pleasures and
pains, and thereby ensure securing the greatest possible amount
of the former with the least possible of the latter.

So in Ethics, no less than in Physics‚ we see that all idea of
higher and more spiritual life is absent: in both the divine
element is lacking.

Professor Mayor sums up Epicureanism in a concise and
telling phrase. ‘I arn inclined to think Cicero was not very
wide of the mark when he spoke of it as a “bourgeois
philosophy '² (Cic. Iltsc. i. 55 plebeii philosopln').' It did not
care for science, it did not value truth for its own sake, it did
not stir the soul to action and it did not foster a self-sacrificing
spirit. But it is easier to see these defects through the clearing-
glasses of time than for contemporaries to detect them, and
what was a philosophy to the master became a religion to the
disciple‚ and Lucretius in his enthusiastic admiration for
Epicurus preached the gospel of Epicureanism more servently
than its founder, exclaiming with conviction and veneration
from the depths of his heart ‘deus ille fuit, deus’ (bk. v. 8).
