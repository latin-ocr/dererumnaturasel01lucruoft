INTRODUCTION

rather on his philosophy of life, and this philosophy is a
practical one: he spoke of the world to man for man’s good,
for he believed that a true knowledge of the universe and
its creation would free mankind from the childish terrors of
superstitious ignorance and raise them to a higher level of
intelligence and to a nobler comprehension of life.

THE STYLE OF LUCRETIUS

Lucretius was, at any rate in literature, laudator temporis
acti. He read and admired the older writers and he imitated
the ancient poets : Homer and Empedocles among the Greeks,
Ennius and the older tragedians among the Latin poets, were
studied diligently by him and naturally had considerable
influence on his language and turn of expression. He is fond
of using old and half-forgotten forms of words: he uses and
invents many compound adjectives of the Greek type, such
as vussrivagas, levz‘smnnus, anguimanus, pennipotens, bucerus,
and the like z instances of ἅπαξ λεγόμενα are frequent. Allitera-
tion and assonance, a characteristic feature in the early
literature of any nation‚ play a prominent part, especially where
the poet wishes to drive a point home.

The Lucretian hexameter is distinctly in advance of that
of Ennius, yet it is closer to the rugged verse of the older
poet than to the smoothness and elaborate finish of the
V ergilian line. He is ready to use spondaic endings, he uses
monosyllables‚ quadrisyllables, and polysyllables to close a line,
he seems almost to prefer archaic terminations of substantives
and verbs: he makes free use of tmesis, inverted tmesis (ordia
prima for primordia, iv. 32 3 facit are for arefacit, vi. 962), and
ellsion : he frequently marks off the first two feet from the rest
of the line, interrupting the rhythm by a sudden jerk. One
of the especial features in the verse of Lucretius is his method
of dealing with the fourth foot, which is frequently contained
in a single word and ends with it, while Vergil prefers to have
a caesura. For instance Vergil writes ‘arma virumque cano
Troiae qui primus ab oris ³, inverting the natural order of Troiae
