LUCRETIUS V. 495-51 1

495. terrae . . . pondus, ‘the ponderous mass of earth': cf.
l. 1242 argenti pondus plumbique potestas, l. 1286 ferri vis aerisque.
See too 11. 557, 720, 726.

496. constitit, ‘consolidated’

quasi: apologetic for the strange word limus, ‘slime’ as
applied to mundus 3 see notes, ll. 360, 778.
497. gravis: translate adverbially, as levis, l. 4 59.
498. Notice the recurrence of τ’.
aer : the lower, thicker atmosphere.
aether: the higher, purer ether.
499. liquidis, ‘clear-streaming.'
omnia gathers up the substantives in the preceding line.
pura: to be taken predicatively.

500. alia: sc. relicta sunt. See note on l. 470.

501. Notice the dactylic hexameter to emphasize the idea of
lightly-rnoving ether.

super follows its case here. Ov. Asel. i. 67 liquidum et
gravitate carentem aethera nec quicquam terrenae faecis habentem.

502. turbantibus aeris auris, ‘ the troubled currents of air!

turbantibus: as turbare, l. 504, intransitive. So in ii. 126.
Cf. 1. 831, vertere for verti.

503. haec omnia : all this troubled air, the lower atmosphere.

504. turbare: intransit.; as l. 502.

505. certo . . . impete, ⁴ with steady sweep.'

impete is archaic for impetu: common in Lucretius. In vi.
327 he has the genitive, impetis.

506. modice . . .‚ ‘gently and with uniform efforts Notice how
Lucretius uses an adverb and abl. of matter as parallels.

507. Pontos: the Euxine flows with a steady current towards
the Mediterranean. Seneca, N. Q. iv. 2. 29 Pontus . . . adsidue
fluit . . . in unam partem semper pronus et torrens. Shakespeare‚
Otlzello, iii. 3 ‘ Like to the Pontick sea Whose (53. current Qusswbl’ussffl' (Μ
Ne'er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on To the Propontick ’.

508. The steady rhythm of the line is intended to express the
steady flow of the Pontus. Gray's Elegy ‘ They kept the noiseless
tenor of their way ².

509—33. Munro: ‘This passage . . . stands in no connexion with
what precedes and follows. 1. 534 should at once follow l. 508. . . .
The passage generally interrupts the fine flow and connexion '. It
was in fact probably a later addition which was never properly

grafted into the book.

509. sit: indirect question. As Duff remarks, there is no
special mention of the planets here or elsewhere in the book.

510. Here Lucretius appears to hesitate to assert that the
heavens revolve, though in 11. 505 and 1436 mundi magnum
versatile templum he speaks definitely of their revolution. l. 624
Democritus believes in the revolution of the sky. Here the first
possible reason is given for the movement of the stars.

511. ex utraque parti, ‘at each end' or ‘pole’ of the axis of
the heavenly sphere; the north pole or south pole.
