INTRODUCTION

and created by the gods. The gods were in reality totally
indifferent to the affairs of mankind: indeed there was no
inducement for them to exchange their leisured bliss for the
anxiety of world-building: surely t00, if the gods had made
the world, it would have been both more perfect and happier.
Rather Nature is the great creative principle. The world and
all that is in it is mortal: water, air, fire, stones‚ ether itself‚
all gradually decay and die away. Earth too had its beginning
and must have its end.

He then proceeds to describe the formation of the world
out of indestructible atoms which collided and combined : the
heavier particles forming the earth, the lighter ones composing
the ether and the heavenly bodies, the result being that the
earth sank and the ether rose. Next he endeavours to
describe and account for the motions and courses of the
heavenly bodies and to explain the nature of the sun, which
he with the Epicureans maintained was really of the size that
it appeared to them. After this follows a description of the
recurrence of days and nights, of the succession of the seasons,
and an explanation of the causes of eclipses.

At this point our selection ends, but he continues in fulfil-
ment of his promise with the story of the creation of herbage,
anirnals, birds, and lastly man produced from earth, the all-
mother. He denies the possibility of beings of twofold nature,
such as Centaurs, Satyrs, Scylla, and the like. Then follows
an account of the earliest life of primitive inan, the beginnings
of social intercourse, the discovery of fire, and the development
of civilization. And now Lucretius launches out into a bitter
indictrnent of religion and describes its evil effects upon man.
Next he tells of the discovery os the use of metals‚ the conse-
quent development of war and its instruments‚ the cultivation
of the soil, the beginnings of music, and the recognition of the
recurrence of seasons. Naturally resulting from these arts
corne the closer life and communion of man with man, the
discovery of letters, the beginnings of history, and the progress
of the arts and luxuries of life gradually leading up to the
elaborate civilization of thc poet's own day.
