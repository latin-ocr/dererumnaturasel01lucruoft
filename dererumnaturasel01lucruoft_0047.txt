LUCRETIUS v. 25-44

612ὁί denique: here as often in Lucretius = porro, praeterea, not
ast y .

27. vallata: a strong word, lit. surrounded by a vallum, a
pa1isade, or entrenchment.

posset is practically equal in meaning to obesset here.

28. tripectora: ἅπαξ λεγ.; cf. Verg. Aen. vi. 289 forma tricor-
poris umbrae. Aesch. Ag. 870 calls him τρισώμιιτος. Notice the
archaic genit, Geryonai ; cf. l. 69 lunai.

tergemini: poetical for trzgemz'm'. Observe how Lucretius
piles up his epithets almost to redundance.

This line was supplied by Munro: he suggests that it may
hage sapen out from the fact that it began with qm'd as the pre-
ce mg me.

29. officerent : as obesset above, 1. 25. These may be the
Harpies.

30. Imitated by Verg. Gemg. ii. 140 tam-i spirantes naribus zssngenz.

31. propter: Duff observes that propser, meaning ‘near '‚ is
frequently found, as here, after the word it governs; cf. 11. 623,
738. But contrast l. 35. Cf. eum contra, 1. 708, loca . . . inimica
per, l. 770.

32. aurea . . . fulgentia: see note, l. 13.

33. asper, acerba tuens: another line imitated by Verg. Aen.
ix. 794. Observe the adverbial use of the adj. Cf. l. 91 plura.

35. pelagi: genit. depending on severa used as a subst. ; cf. l. 417
pontique profunda. Others read pelage, a Greek plur. as in vi. 619.
Cf. mele and cete from μέλος and κῆτος.

36. noster is opposed to barbarus and therefore is obviously for
the prose nostras. With audet sc. adire.

37. cle genere hoc: for lucius generis ε so too l. 164.

38. In this line we have an apodosis with a double protasis si . . .
serent . . . viva (= si viverent).

39. ita, ⁴ to such an extent.'

satiatem : melrigralia for satietatem. Cf. l. 184.

40. scatit: as in 11. 598, 952 saltare. Lucretius uses this verb
both in the second and third conjugation3 cf. 1. 1095Ῐηζξένε. The
proper construction is with the abl.

41. profundas: running deep back into the hills 3 nemora and
silvas are practically the same3 cf. note, 1. 5.

42. quae ε translate as et ea.

est nostra potestas : Lucretius uses this periphrasis for pos-
sumus more than once.

43. purgatumst: purgalum est3 the combination of these two
syllables in erasis was less offensive to the Roman ear than actual
elision in poetry‚ especially in the case of monosyllables as in the
next line, tumst3 cf. 1. 131. The phrase is like puro pectore, l. 18.

43⁴4. proelia . . . pericula ε note the use of the gerund in the ac-
tive, instead of the passive gerundive, which would be the construction
in prose. Lucretius uses the former construction not infrequently.
It is found in Cic. de δέπαϊ. 2. 6 viam qnam nobis ingrediendmn
sil, Duff: ‘ This construction was dropped by later writers, though
