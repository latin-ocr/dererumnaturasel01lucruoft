LUCRETIUS V. 182—92

exemplum, ‘ pattern ', ‘ model '.

182. notities: cf. l. 1047 unde insita notities est . . . quid vellet
facere ut sciret animoque videret? This is a poetical though not
strictly accurate translation of the term πρόληψις used by Epicurus
to signify preconception based on knowledge gained from former
experiences. see the Introduction, Philosophy of Epicurus (antzci-
patio or praenotio is the more accurate equivalent used by prose
writers). Mankind can have an idea or conception (πρόληψις) of
the gods, because the gods have existed from everlasting; on the
other hand the gods could have no conception of mankind, no
pattern (exemplum), to imitate, because, as Duff says : ‘if no men
existed there could be no (εἴδωλα, simulacra) images of them and
consequently no (πρόληψις) conception of what they were like)

183. vellent, indirect question ; this sentence depends on
scirent . . . viderent, which are consecutive subj.

184. prineipiorum: metm'grall'a in Lucretius forprz'mordl'orzcm;
cf. ll. 39, 671 ; primordia or prinmrdia rerum 11. 187, 419, 437 310
the ἀρχαί, or ἀρχαὶ τῶν ὄντων of Epicurus, the atoms practically
= elementa (στοιχεῖα) the ultimate and indivisible elements of
matter: they are solid and contain no void (τὸ κειόιν, inane) : they
differ in weight‚ size, and shape (cf. 1. 440), and are unlimited in
number and ever moving, either downwards by their own weight
(pondus), or sideways or upwards by chance collision (plaga, l. 363
and 11. 436-9) with other atomS, and it is this incessant movement
and chance collisions of atoms that formed the world : Verg. Ecl. vi.
31 magnum per imme coacta semime. This is practically the
modern atomic theory.

185. quid . . . possent: 35 in l. 87. Construction is subj. of
issdirect question acting· as second subject to cognita, and parallel to
t e subst. vis.

186. natura: see notes to ll. 77 and 107, which prove how the
Epicureans identified nature (natura) with chance (fortuna). Cf.
l. 1361 specimen rationis . . . ipsa filit rernm primum nalum
crealrix.

187. Notice the m alliteration.

multa is used adverbially‚ and is not to be taken with pri-
mordia: 11. 187-91 310 repeated 11.422—6.

188. plagis.. .ponde1=ibus: see note, 1.184, where the forma-

tion of things 15 shown to be due to the collision (p lewis) and the

downward mox ement caused by the weight (ponder‘zbus) of the
atoms

189. consuerunt: trisyllable‚ as in 11. 661, 702. See note, l. 53.
190. omnimodis: as in ll.718‚ 1024 formed on the false analogy
of multi'modzs (multi’ modis) 7122U'rzmodzs (mim modzs): so this
should be omnz'ssbumodzs Observe the halting rhythm and the
heavy spondaic quadrisyllable ending the line.
191. possent: indirect question.
quaecumque is the object.
congressa in agreement with primordia, the subject.
192. disposituras: only in Lucretius, ‘arrangements’; mclm‘
