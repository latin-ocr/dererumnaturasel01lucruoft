LUCRETIUS V. 765-79

rigidas coni . . . umbras, ‘the well-defined conical shadows
(of the earth).’ rigidas: cf. poet. ap. Cic. T use. i. 37 mgida . ..
calzgo, ‘ darkness that may be felt.’ coni. . . umbras: the cone of
the earth’s shadow. coni defines umbras, acting as an adj.; see
note, 1. 369. Lucretius' theory of the flat shape of the earth (note,
l. 535) hardly agrees with his statement here of its conical shadows3
Munro suggests that he accepted this latter theory blindly from the
observations of astronomers. With 'regard to menstrua this
epithet should not be pressed3 it does not mean ‘every month ⁷,
but ‘occasionally in her course which, as a matter of fact, lasts
a month'; otherwise we should be making Lucretius say that
there was a lunar eclipse every month. This would only happen
if her orbit lay in the plane of the sun's ecliptic.

765. nequeat: sc. cur, deliberative question.

tempore eodem: see note, l. 756.
succurrere =succedere, ‘pass beneath’3 only here in this
sense.

766. supra: preposition. During a lunar eclipse the sun is
supposed to be below the earth, which intercepts the sun's light and
prevents the moon from reflecting the sun's rayS.

perlabier: archaic infin.; cf. note, l. 51.

767. interrumpat, ‘ intercept’; consecutive subj.

768. et tamen ε as in l. 213, ‘and after all '3 putting this or other
considerations out of the way.

769-70. For the sentiment cf. 758-61 of the sun.

h languescere, ‘be exhausted and grow faint’ : as languidus of
t e sun.

770. per: out of place, for per loca ; as Duff says, its proximity
to inimica makes it less harsh. See note, l. 31 ; cf. l. 869 suo sine
. . . laborm so in i. 841 ignibus ex, vi. 1264 viam per.

771. This line is omitted3 it is the same as l. 764. See note,

772. quod superest : see note, l. 64, ‘moreover.'

caerula mundi: see note, 1. 651, ‘ the blue vaults of heaven)
mundi = caeli.

776. quove: see note, l. 71.
offecto: very rare in the personal passive, ‘blocked out.'
obire, ‘ be blotted out,' perish. N otice the alliteration.

777. neque opinantis rare: for the more usual form necopi-

nam‘is, ‘little expecting it.'
obducere. ob has an adversative force in compounds.

778. quasi: apologetic for the word conivent as applied to the
heavenly bodies; see notes, ll. 360, 496.
