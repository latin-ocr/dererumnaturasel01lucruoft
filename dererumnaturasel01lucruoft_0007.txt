PREFACE

THIS edition of the first half of the fifth book of Lucretius
has been prepared as objections have been raised that it was
unsatisfactory to read only the latter half of the book and that
it was therefore advisable to complete the edition.

The object of the earlier book was to introduce the poem of
Lucretius to lower forms than usual, but as the latter half is
considerably easier than the earlier, I believe it would be
a practicable solution to read the second part in one term and
the first part in the following. This is a feasible suggestion,
strange though it may seem, for the creation of the things in
the world (ll. 783-1457) might easily precede, as being simpler‚

· the more complicated account of the creation of the world and

the formation of the heavenly bodies (ll. 1—782). Then, after
being gradually accustomed to the style of Lucretius, the harder
and more philosophica] portion could be read with greater ease
later.

As was the case with the earlier edition this also is based
on Munro's ‘magnum opus ², and owes very much to Mr. Duff⁷s
admirable book, especially with regard to the astronomy, and
also to the care and suggestions of the reader of the Clarendon
Press. The text is practically that of the Clarendon Press.
