THE POEM ‘DE RERUM NATURA‘

THE POEM ‘DE RERUM NATURA'

The title of the poem is a Latin translation of the title of
a similar didactic Epic by Empedocles called περὶ φύσεως written
in the fifth century B.C.

Lucretius wished to expound the doctrines of Epicurus not
merely from a desire to put before his readers the theory of
his physical system, but chiefly from a deeply rooted wish to
free mankind from the terrors of death which are caused by
the belief in a future life: he therefore determined to explain
the true nature of things.

Books one and two describe fully the physical theories of
Democritus and Epicurus, dwelling on the nature of atonis
and void, which form the chief component factors of the
universe. In these two books he mentions only to refute
them the systems of other philosophers. Book three shows
that the soul is itself a material part of man and perishes when
the body dies. The next book deals with the Epicurean
theory of the senses. The fifth book falls into two parts,
describing first the creation of the world, second the evolution
of man and the beginnings of society. In the last book
Lucretius puts before us a miscellany of natural phenomena
and curiosities in nature, which he certainly intended to
rearrange and systematize before it was actually published,

though he was in all probability prevented from doing this
by his untimely death.

THE SUBJECT-MATTER OF THE FIFTH BOOK

This book, which contains some of the very finest work
of Lucretius, forms two great epics‚ the creation of the world,
and the creation and development of man.

The book opens with a panegyric on Epicurus. The poet
then promises a sketch of the creation of the world and of the
heavenly bodies and their movements‚ in order that men may
realize the mortal nature of the world and not be enslaved to
the terrors of superstition by the belief that it was designed
