INTRODUCTION

THE LIFE OF LUCRETIUS

THE life of Lucretius, as it is usually accepted, is given here
without any examinatior] of the conflicting accounts and
theories put forward by different editors.

Titus Lucretius Carus was born probably Β. C. 99 and died
October 15, B.c. 55. The statement that his death was due
to suicide during a fit of madness caused by drugs must be
regarded with suspicion: the story of the love—philtre would
be suggested by the contemptuous attitude of the poet towards
love in the fourth book, while the fiction of his insanity might
be readily invented by the Christian writers who found his
attitude towards religion so abhorrent. He was almost certainly
a man of good family: his name is that of an old patrician
house, and he addresses Memmius, himself of high birth, in
a tone of serene equality.

Lucretius was a man of literary tastes and he showed no
inclination for political life, more especially during the troublous
times of the struggles between Pompey and Caesar. He was
moreover an Epicurean and the Epicureans had no sympathy
with politics. He lived the life of a student and busied him-
self with the works of the Greek authors and the old Latin
writers, but above all he devoted himself to the philosophy of
Epicurus3 and the result of his lifework is the presentation
of that philosophy in the didactic poem De Rerum Mzturcz in
six books, a work that is not the production of a madman,
whatever defects it may contain. Moreover, as Prof. Mackail
in his Latin Literature says: ‘Many of the most important
physical discoveries of modern times are hinted at or even
expressly stated by Lucretius.’ Indeed his theories of the
atomie doctrine, of light, of evolution, and of the ultimate
constitution of atonis have won the admiration of modern
scientists. Yet, aster all, the true greatness of Lucretius rests
