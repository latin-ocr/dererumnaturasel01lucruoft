581—4. This is rather a complicated sentence. Take quando-
quidem . . . praebet first, then quapropter . . . necesse est with hinc
. . . in allo, lastly nl est . . . qzmntast.

videatur is passive and depends on necesse esf.

hine, ‘ from here on earth ’ : as in 1. 572.

ut has nothing to do with videatur, but belongs to cumque,
tmesis z see note, l. 287.

utcumque = ul, ‘ exactly as it is defined in its outlines (oris
extremis, ‘its extreme edges ’) and precisely as large as it is.'

que, quoquo = quocumque: cf. utut, ubiubi.

decreasing in appearance).

perparvum quiddam: adverbial acc. Cf. nil, 1. 569, and
hilum l. 3 8.
589, αηέΐαω utram : a harsh elision. Elsewhere, cf. 1.68 5 alter-

tance away.'
