THE STYLE OF LUCRETIUs

qui: Lucretius, on the other hand, would be almost certain to
retain the natural order qui Troiae, and would be content
to dispense with the caesura which Vergil prefers to have. So
in our book Lucretius writes ‘sine puro pectore vivi, quod
tangi non licet ipsum, cum pulchre degeret aevum ³, where in
all probability Vergil would have written ‘ puro sine pectore. . .‚
tangi quod non . . ., pulchre cum degeret . . .' Sometimes his
muse creeps and he indulges in unpoetical phrases, quod
superest, lzzlc accedit, fateare necessest, and other logical formulae
more suited to a philosophical treatise in prose.

A strange peculiarity in Lucretius should also be noticed:
time and again we shall observe as we read this selection that
he gives several reasons, several causes, several explanations‚
for one phenomenon of nature, as for example when he wishes
to explain eclipses 3 of these explanations it not infrequently
happens that only one is correct, possible, scientific, or even
reasonable, yet he puts them all before the reader on an equal
footing, showing little indication of his own preference. What
is the reason for this peculiar behaviour? The answer is this.
There is a simple precept in the Epicurean κανονική, which is
an immediate deduction from the supremacy of αἴσθησις, namely,
that in cases where αἴσθησις gives us no direct information,
all explanations which do not conflict with the evidence of
the senses are to be regarded as equally probable. Further,
his object is also to ensure free will, unbiased judgement on
the part of the reader: at all costs he will guard against them
entertaining the hypothesis of divine agency or necessary law :
the student must be free to use his own individual thought
(a theory very different from the absolute Necessity, ἀνάγκη, of
the Stoic philosophy), and so he practically tells them that
they must not suppose that similar effects must always proceed
from the same causes, and therefore he gives them a choice
of various hypotheses to explain the various phenomena of
nature. It is not a scientific attitude, but it is very charac-
teristic of Lucretius, who sought first and foremost in this poem
to ensure for mankind freedom from religious superstition and
freedom of individual thought.
