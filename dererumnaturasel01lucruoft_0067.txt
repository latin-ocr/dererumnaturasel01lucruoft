LUCRETIUS v, 376-94

376. What is mortalis must be also nativus, things that have an
end must have a beginning, things which perish cannot have existed
from infinite time past. Cf. note, 1. 315.

379. This line is repeated in l. 1217. Notice the v alliteration.

380. cum: causal.

cum maxima mundi membra, ‘the sovereign members . . .’
Notice the alliteration of six m's. The sovereign members are fire
and water which are always at strife, each endeavouring to gain
the mastery over the other; witness the old legends of the poets.

381. pio nequaquam = impio: especially of civil war. Livy i.
32. 12 puro pioque duello, not a civil war.

382. nonne vides : rather late in the sentence for a question to
be introduced.

aliquam : finem is here feminine: so in ll. 826, 1213, 1432 ; it
is usually masc. though ante· and post-Classical writers and poets
use it in the feminine. There is only one instance of the plural
with a feminine adj. Varro, L. L. v. 1. 13.

ollis : the archaic form of illis ; so too in ll. 1291, 1390.

383. vel eum should be answered by another vel, but in l. 386
Lucretius changes the construction and there is an anacoluthon.
It is met with occasionally in all the best Greek and Latin writers.
Cf. note, ll. 447, 460, 851-3 ut sint . . . habere.

384. exsuperarint: for exsuperaverlnt: fut. perf. because cum
is purely temporal. This is to take place by evaporation.

385. faeere intendunt: the infin. after intendo is rare: it is
poetical, and not in the best prose-writers.

neque adhue: Duff = sed nondum. Other editors emend
patrantur to patrarunt.

386. The anacoluthon begins with this line: we should expect
vel cnm.

tantum : acc. after suppeditans, sc. aquae.
ultra: adverb, ‘ besides.'

387. diluviare: ἅπαξ λεγόμενον. minor is occasionally followed
by the pres. instead of the fut. infin. See L. ἃ S. minor II. A. δ,
Cf. confidunt posse, l. 390.

388-9. These lines are repeated from 266—7‚ practically word for
word.

390. confidunt posse: see l. 387 and note.

omnia : object to siccare.

391. possit: in Lucretius prius quam, ante quam take the subj.
unless the quam clause precedes ante iii. 973 quam nascimur ante,
or prius vi. 979 quam adgredior . . . prius. Munro gives various
insgances at iii. 973. ‘ Before water can attain the end of its
en eavour.

392. aequo = ancipiti, ⁴ undecided.’
certamine . . . cernere certant, ‘ strive to decide. . . .² cerno
= decerno, in a different sense inl. 782. Observe the assonance.
394. eum: concessive.
interea, ‘ by the way.’ Cf. note, l. 83.
superantior, ‘predominant’ : ἅπαξ λεγόμενον.
