INTRODUCTION

The poem leaves on the reader, and still more on the hearer,
an impression of great vigour and latitude of expression un-
trammelled by the elaboration considered necessary by the
later poets. Mr. Duff in his introduction aptly quotes the
words of Munro: ‘It has often struck rne that his genius is
akin to that of Milton. He displays a wonderful depth and
fervour of thought, expressed in language of singular force
and beauty 3 an admirable faculty of clear, vigorous, and well-
sustained philosophical reasoning 3 and a style equal in its
purity and correctness to that of Terence, Caesar or Cicero,
and superior to that of any writer of the Augustam age.' And
Mrs. Browning in Α Vz’siolz of Poets says :

. He denied
Divinely the divine, and died
Chief poet on the Tiber-side.

Another great asset possessed by Lucretius is the imaginative
insight and exuberant originality with which he pictures to himself
and unfolds to his readers the long periods of the early struggles
of primitive man in the dim recesses of the past, until gradually,
by the processes of evolution, they reached that development
of civilization which culminated in the civilization of the poet's
own day (‘ ad summum donec venere cacumen ²).

Mommsen closes his sketch of Lucretius with this tribute:
‘ The didactic poem concerning the Nature of Things, however
much in it may challenge censure, has remained one of the
most brilliant stars in the poorly illuminated expanse of Roman
literature.⁷
