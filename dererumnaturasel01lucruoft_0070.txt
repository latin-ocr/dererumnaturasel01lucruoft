437. omne genus : see note, 1. 428.
principiis = primordiis, metri gratia : see note, l. 184.
quorum. Munro hesitates between making this depend on
(1) discordia, (2) intervalla, ἃς. The former seems slightly pre-
ferable.
438—9. Notice the very strong asyndeton: see l. 75.
turbabat governs all these accusatives.
coneXUS, ‘ connexions.’
concursus, ‘ clashings.’ These two lines occur in ii. 726—7.
proelia miscens: in prose would be proelia conserens.
f440.8The atoms are of different size‚ shape, and also weight.
C . 1. 1 4.
figuras, ⁴ shapes’: sometimes = εἶδος or ἰδέα of Democritus,
meaning ‘atoms', in Lucretius. Take quod from the following
line, at the beginning of this sentence.
441. sio = sicut erant, ‘just as they were.’
442. Translate, ‘nor sall into mutually harmonious movements.’
For molus dare (=flzcere) see notes, ll. 347, 421.
44 3. inde loci: so too 11. 741, 791 (cf. l. 807 ubi loa‘, and postea loci,
‘ afterwards ’) ; partitive genitive, ‘in the next place.' Observe the
constant repetition of the dis· and se· in the compounds in the
next six lines. Duff adds that dis· denotes the separation of several,
se— of two things.
444. discludere mundum, ‘mark off the world)
446. secernere eaelum. Cf. Genesis i. 6 ‘ Let there be a firma-
ment in the midst of the waters . . . called the firmament Heaven'.
447. sorsum . . . sorsus. Lucretius uses sorsum, seorsum and
sorsus, seorsus quite indifferently. In five lines iv. 491-5 he has
scorsum once, seorsus twice, sorsum twice. In ii. 202 deorsum
trisyllable‚ ii. 205 deorsum disyllable. See note on sursum, 1. 465.
Notice the change in construction from the infinitive to ut con-
secutive with the subj. See note, ll. 383, 460.
secreto umore, ‘ with water unmixed' = mero umore.
448. secreti: with aetheris, ‘of ether umnixed ’ not with zgrnes3
i. e. the heavenly bodies.

terrai: as in l. 431. See note, 1. 67.

450. perplexa: sc. inter se3 as in l. 452 ‘closely entangled'3
in ii. 394 we have perque plsmtis (elementis).

451. in medio. The accus. would be more natural after coibant,
but there is also the idea of rest coming from capiebant sedis.

453. tam : for lanto ; but see l. 487 where tam again corresponds
to quanto, but 1. 489 lanso.

454. efficerent: consecutive subj. Notice the m alliteration.
l magni moenia mundi (ιε caelz‘): the fiery ether3 see note,
. 371.

455. levibus: observe the quantity of the first syllable.

456. minoribu’ : see note, l. 53. Ether and fire was composed
