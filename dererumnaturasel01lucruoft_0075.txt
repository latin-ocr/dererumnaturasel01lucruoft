526. sit: indirect question.
ponere eertum, ‘ to lay down sor certain.'
527. possit fiatque. · indirect questions after doceo.
per 0111110, ‘throughout the whole universe' ε as in ..l 530.

528. varia ratione creatis, ‘formed on varying designs!

529. sequor disponere: for pen> σο dz'sp0ne7¹e; cf. iii. 420 pergam
dzsponere.

sequor: with infin. only here, though its compounds et¹35eq2202
persequor are used with the infin.
11111113,ί a number of.’

530. quae possint, esse, which may exist for.

531. siet hic: emendation sor MS. reading which cannot be
translated. It is an archaic form of 522¹, and may be tiaced
back to an old optative form (cf. note, l. 196) s- 2e- m, Greek
ἐσ- ιε· μ = εἵην.

532. vegeat: a rare verb found m Ennius3 it is the transitive of
vzgeo, with motum, ‘imparts a lively movement to . . .’: consecu-
tive subj.

quae: interrog.
earum: sc. causarum.

533. Notice thep alliteration. In l. 1453 we find the still stronger
phrase paulatim . . . pedetemptim progredientis.
progredientis ε the adjectival genitive, ‘it is not characteristic
of.. .’

5 34 ut: final.

535. ⁴ It 1s proper that the earth s weight should pass away and
decrease' : i. e. on the lower side, underneath, subter.

evanescere et decrescere. an instance of hysteron proteron,
as ll. 625-6 evanescere . . . lmmmlnltz. Lucretius seems to think
that the surface of the earth is more or less flat (but see note,
1. 764), both above and beneath, and that its weight gradually
decreased underneath in order to preserve its position in the middle
of the world, for he knew nothing of the laws of attraction. ¹

536. naturam, ‘substance’ or consistency’.

537. uniter aptam: a favourite phrase of Lucretius, ll. 555 558,
‘formed into one beingst
uniter: a strange form of the adverb, cf. damur, l. 1402,
though as Duff remarks the form of the genit. and dat. of unus
make it more easy to account for.
538. partibus ε dative after coniunctam . . . aptam.
vivit 2 subject is term ; as Munro says it seems harsh to apply
this verb to bncta terra. But probably the parallel case of the
human body which he is about to draw influences his choice of
words. See to'o the note on viva, l. 476. cf. l. 402.
539. 11011 eet oneri: sc. terra? (subject) and auris (dative of dis-
advanta e .
onegri): predicative dat., as 1. 541, ‘ The earth does not weigh
heavily on the airy portions of the world.'>
540. homini: dat. of possessor.
