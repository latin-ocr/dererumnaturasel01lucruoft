NOTES

1. potis is an indecl. adj.; cf. l. 560 quid potis est, l. 719 nec
potis est cerni. The form pote, which is also used by Lucretius,
is merely a weakened form of potis and is not the neuter. For
instance we find qui potis est? Catull. 72. 7, ‘ how is it possible?'
and conversely nec quisquam pote dicere, C atull. 67. 11, ‘no one is
able to say ². We also find polis used with plural auxiliary verbs.
For the weakened form pote Duff aptly cites mage and magis.

potis pollenti pectore : notice the alliteration of the p and t:
always be on the watch for alliteration in reading Lucretius: he
often uses it when he wishes to drive a point home; cf. ll. 11—12
below, and 1. 53.

dignum . . . pro: the usual construction after dzjgnum is the
plain ablative, but it is followed also, though rarely, by pro and ad
in Cicfzro and the poets: perhaps pro has the force ‘in considera-
tion ο '.

pectore : the heart, not the head, was considered by Lucretius
to be the seat of the intellect. See ll. 18, 103.

2. repertis : here a subst.‚ as in 1. 13 below.

3. qui . . . possit: qui consecutive followed by the subj.

4. eius qui: Epicurus, the great master of Lucretius. His
philosophy was based upon that of Democritus, mentioned in terms
of great reverence l. 622. See Introduction: The Philosophy of
Epicurus,

5. parta . . . quaesita are probably synonymous terms; we
shall find that Lucretius frequently employs repetition of words of
similar meaning even where he does not intend to convey any
especial force or meaning3 cf. l. 314. Others have taken it as
a case of hysteron proteron, ‘obtained and sought,' but this is
most unlikely.

liquit: left to his intellectual heirs.

6. cretus, from cresco, has here the meaning ‘ sprung from’‚
with no sense of the meaning of increase usually conveyed by cresce.

7. si ut: an instance of hiatus: the quantity of sz' is shortened
here ; cf. l. 74 quiin orbi. Duff: ‘This hiatus is very common in
Plautus and Terence and is even found in Horace sz' mc* amas and
Vergil le? amice)

8. deus flle fuit: deus as used by Verg. Ecl. ν. 64 deus, deus ille,
Menalca. For a similar expression cf. 1. 622 Democriti sancta
sententia. See note, l. 19.

Memmi: Gaius Memmius was a Roman noble of distinguished
birth: after holding the praetorship he served as propraetor of
Bithynia. It was to this Memmius that Lucretius dedicated his
poem. NVhether he was actually worthy of the honour is open to
doubt. The passage deus ille fuit, deus, qui princeps (= primus)
