THE PHILOSOPHY OF EPICURUS

human nature and the freedom of individual thought against
the oppression of superstitious religion. Mere knowledge on
the other hand he contended was in itself of no value or interest.

Epicurus based his philosophy on the axiom that experience
alone was the foundation-stone of certainty: experience is to
be gained from the impressions of the senses : therefore sensa-
tion is the standard of truth. If an error is made, it lies not
in the sensation, but in our interpretation of the sensation, in
the inferences we draw from it. Repeated sensations produce
a permanent image, a preconception (notities or anticipatio,
πρόληψις) in the mind.

In Physics, the reason for studying this science, the study
of Nature, was to free mankind from the traminels of religion
and superstition, by proving the creation of the universe to be
due to mechanical causes. He denied divine agency in the
creation of the world, maintaining that it was the result of the
fortuitous collision and combinations of immutable and irre-
ducible atonis, and that the meeting of these atonis was
rendered possible by their own perpetual downward and oblique
motion and by the existence of void (inane, wczmm, τὸ κενόν).
He held that numberless worlds were continually coming into
existence and passing away again. The soul itself, partly
irrational life (anima, ψυχή), partly rational power (animus,
λόγος), he believed to be composed of the lightest and finest
atonis, of the same nature therefore as the body, though more
agile owing to the excessive lightness of,its composition, yet
it will perish with the body, its ethereal atoms will pass away
into the purer ether, as the coarser atoms of the body will
pass back into the all-mother earth ε consequently it will have
no future existence, for it has no divine element any inore
than the material and tangible world. And if there is no after-
existence, then we can throw off the base fear of death which
precludes happiness in this life and oppresses men’s hearts with
superstitious dread of the gods.

The gods, they are immortal, they live in perfect bliss in the
upper ether (z'ntermundz'm μετακόσμια) ; why should they throw
aside their leisured happiness to create a world sor nien? it
