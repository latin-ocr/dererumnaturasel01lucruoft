LUCRETIUS V. 73-83

vesci voluptatibus: and cf. l. 857 vesci vitalibus auris, where the
meaning is closer to the usual signification of the word.

73. divum metus: it is this superstitious sear which men call
religion that Lucretius wishes to drive from their minds by showing
how illogical it is.

74. qui in ε for the hiatus cf. note, 1. 7.

orbi is the archaic abl. as in 1. 707. Cf. ll. 142, 604 zgm',
ll. 511, 721part22
saneta: predicative.

75. Notice the asyndeton, contrastl. 115 See especially ll 438—9.

77 flectat: subj. of indirect question. The metap hor is from
steering a ship as i.nl 12. The metaphor is taken from the sea.
Cf. l. 107 flectat fortuna gubernans. Munro· . ‘The Epicurean nature
is at one and the same time blind chance and inexorable necessity.’
This may be an exaggerated remark, but it contains some truth.
See note, l. 186.

79. libera sponte : see note, 1. 47.

cursus perennis, ‘traverse their ceaseless orbits,’ internal acc.
after lustrare. Cic. N. D. ii. 5 3 latitudinem lustrans szgnz'feri orbis.

80. morigera ad: morzgerus is also constructed with the dat.

selves bound by the absolute law of nature: they neither move
independently nor are they controlled by the gods.

81. ratione, ‘ forethought‚’ the reasoning mind which plans out
a carefully prepared line of action.

82. securum agere aevum: as in Tennyson‚ Latos-Eaters:

‘ In the hollow Lotos-land to live and lie reclined

On the hills like Gods together, careless of mankind.

For they lie beside their nectar . . .

XVhere they smile in secret, looking over wasted lands‚

Blight and famine, plague and earthquake, roaring deeps and

fiery sands, . . .

But they smile‚ they find a music centred in a doleful song

Steaming up . . .

Chanted from an ill-used race of men that cleave the soil,

Sow the seed, and reap the harvest with enduring mil,

Stoi-ing yearly little dues of wheat, and wine and oil;

Till they perish and they suffer—some, ’tis whisper'd—-down

in hell

Suffer endless anguish.9
This passage gives a very fair idea of the view which Lucretius

deos didzffcz securum agere (zer um, holds the same view

proof that the author left his work m an unfinished state.’

83. si tamen interea: a rather redundant expression, ‘if how-
