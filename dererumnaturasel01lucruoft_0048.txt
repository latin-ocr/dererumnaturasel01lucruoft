LUCRETIUS v. 44-59

it was always kept in Greek, ὠφελητέον τὴν πόλιν being as good as
ὠφελητέα ἡ πόλις.’ For insinuandum at the end of the line see
note, l. 1 .

44. ingSratis: contr. for ingratiis, from ingratia, not from in-
gratus. Both forms are used in prose and verse.

45. cuppedinis: used by Lucretius for cupido,

47. Observe the unusual, halting rhythm of the line3 this is
emphasized still further by the a of superbia before the sp of
spurcitia being short. Poets of the golden age, for the most part,
do not place a short vowel before sc, sp, st z it is not uncommon in
Propertius, but cf. Ov. Her. v. 26 nostri littera scripta memor, and
the still stronger instance, Lucretius vi. 195 pendentibu' strucms.
1. 79 libera sponte.

sar more than the gods who are supposed to bestow temporal
blessings on mortals.

volvier, 1. 730 amplectier, l. 766 perlabier.

53. immortalibu’: a favourite suppression of final s in
Lucretius: the usage is common also in the earlier Latin poets:
final s, especially in short syllables, was sounded very lightly.
Cf. ll. 456, 627.

de divis dare dieta: notice the alliteration; see note, l. 1.
Cicero tells us that Epicurus wrote a book περὶ Omina: we have only
a few letters and some fragments and quotations left (κύριαί δόξαι,
the creed of Epicurus).

suerit: perf. subj. for su-everit. Cf. l. 912 szzesse, but 6077-
szTerum‘, ll. 189, 661, 702.

54. rerum naturam: i.e. natural science.

dietis is more than mere words; it means ‘sayings ⁹,

55—75. Duff gives a useful hint for translating this long sentence :
‘It may be split up into three sentences of four (55—8), five (59-
63), and twelve (64—75) lines each. In this case dum must not be
translated.

56—7. quo quaeque . . .: rearrange for translation doceo quam
necessum sit quaeque (from quisque) durare in eo foedere (law) quo

necessum: archaic for necesse (neut. adj.); necessus is also
found, see l. 351.

tion of v.
