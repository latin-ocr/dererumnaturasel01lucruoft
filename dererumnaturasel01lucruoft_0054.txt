LUCRETIUS v. 1 27-44

Lucretius, both words meaning ‘ for ’3 it occurs several times in this
book, ll. 240, 449,1062,1169. Cf. etiam . . .quoqz<e‚ l. 153, and
note, l. 245. est, ‘it is possibless but esse, ‘to exist! Observe
(1) how Lucretius piles up his verbs est, esse, posse, putetur, and (2)
how he arranges them to avoid having a number of dependent
infinitives: potest putam posse esse. non est ut putetur= non
potest pulan- . cf. l. 146 non est ut posszs- - non potes, but rather
stronger‚ and non erat utfierz‘ posset.

eonsilium ε 1116 result of consulendi, judgement.

128-41. Almost repeated from iii. 784—97.

129. esse, ‘exist.’ Lucretius’ argument is that you must not
expect to find heterogeneous elements in combination: you do not
find clouds in the sea or blood in trees, nor will you find natura
consilumque animi (or animus alone) cum quovis corpore.

134. quod si posset enim, multo prius ipsa: Munro includes
posset to prius in a bracket, ‘ for this would be much more likely to
happen than that'; then he begins the apodosis at soleret. But
taking the text as it stands, translate, ‘But if it were possible, the
force of the mind would far more be able . . . and would be wont to
be born in . . . and aster all abide in . . .‘ with manere depending
on soleret.

137. tandem, ‘after all,’ a rare use. Munro quotes Plaut. Mil.
Glor. 1062 heu, ecastor, m'mz's vilest tandem. ‘ Gracious, after all
it’ 5 very cheapss
