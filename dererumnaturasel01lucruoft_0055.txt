LUCRETIUS V. 145-61

145. Duff: ‘They have not even life, much less are they

divine.'
vitaliter Ξ ἅπαξ λεγόμενον.

146. non est ut possis = non poles: see note, l. 126.

147. in munda· partibus : Lucretius thought that the gods lived
not ‘ in any parts of the world ’, but in the intermundia of Cicero,
an exact translation of the Greek word μετακόσμια, the term used by
Epicurus, signisying ‘the spaces between the worlds ' in the whole
universe, where the Epicureans believed the gods lived a life of
perfect bliss and repose free from every care: iii. 18 sedesque quietae,
quas neque concutiunt venti nec nubila nimbis aspergunt neque
nix . . . cana cadens violat semperque innubilus aether integit, et
large dffcso lumine rident.

148. tenvis, ‘ fine,' ‘ impalpable‚' so as to be almost incom-
prehensible, 1. 149, and certainly intangible, ll. 150-2. tenvis is
often scanned as a disyllable with the first syllable long.

149. animi mente, ‘the reasoning power of the mind!

videtur: as inl. 139. The Epicureans believed that though
we cannot see the gods the gods are in the image of man, that their
srame and blood is finer and superior, yet similar to our frame and
blood.

deum natura is too tenuis to be comprehended.

150. suffugit: Munro notes this use offugio and its compounds
in the perfect in poetry (metri gratia) where the context requires
the present, and quotes V erg. Aen. ii. 12 horret luctuque refingit.

151. sc. natura deum, as subject to debet contingere (= langere).

nil quod nobis tactile sit (consecutive subj.).

153. The divine nature is so fine that we cannot touch it and it
cannot touch us ; it must therefore dwell in places too fine for our
senses to apprehend. The only tirne we can get any conception of
them is in our sleep.

sedibus: dative.
etiam . . . quoque, pleonastic: see note, 1. 126.
154. de : Munro = secundum, ⁴ after the model of.’
de = de exemplo, de more ( as ad = ad exemplum, ad normam):
for tenues de exemplo emporis eorum.

155. An unfulfilled promise, though he evidently attaches im—

portance to it.
largo sermone: another indication that the poem was never
corn leted.

152-65. A long but not complicated sentence : observe that
dicere is subject to cleszsserest and that voluisse, decere, sas esse
depend on dicere, while affingere, addere, are in apposition to dicere.

sc. deos subject to voluisse.

158. allaudabile: only here and in Plautus ; the reading is sus-
pected. Notice allaudabsle laudare in juxtaposition.

160. sit, subj. : as a subordinate clause in Oratio Obliqua.

ratione, ‘design’ ; πρόνοια, as in 1. 81.
161. gentibus: dat. of advantage.
fundatum perpetuo aevo = szmdasum perpensum (predi-
