LUCRETIUS V. 1937—21 1

gratia for dispositio cf. ll. 39, 184; take quoque with talis in
following line.

193. deciderunt: notice the scansion.

194. qualibus: abl. of origin, ‘ out of which this sum of matter
(i.e. the world) is carried on by constant renewal.’

summa rerum ε as in 1. 237, the world )( summarum summa,

1. 361 = sunmmm summai lolius omnem, vi. 679 ‘the sum of sums ’‚
‘the entire universe⁷ z l. 330, summm, alone, ‘ our world.'

195. eiiam: with pres. subj. as a rule means granting for the
moment some supposition for the sake of argument. We have ut
lam in Cicero, iam utin Livy and Caesar with a similar meaning.

Here it implies, of course, that Lucretius was not ignorant of the
nature of atoms.

sint : subj. of indirect question3 ll. 195-9 occur in ii. 177—81.
d196. ex . . . rationibus, ‘ judging from the arrangements' or
‘ esign’.
ausim: an archaism for andenam cf. l. 730, ausis: perhaps it is
an old optative ; cf. duim (δοίην), edim, velim, sim (s-z’e-nz ε’σ-ιε-μ),
note, ]. 531.

197. reddere, for rationem reddere often in Lucretius : so i. 566
possit reddi = ratio possit reddi. Cic. T use. i. 70 uses adferre sor
rationem adferre.

198. nobis : dative of person concerned.

199. stat: see note tol. 144 : it is a little more than est.

200. caeli depends on impetus, ‘ whirling expanse.'

impetus has a two-sold meaning, (1) force, vehemence, refer-
ring to the revolution of the sky: 1. 510 magnus caeli si vertitur
orbz'53 (2) size, a secondary meaning derived from the former.
principio : answered by inde, 204.
201. inde = ιι tanto.
silvae ferarum: serarum is practically an epithet, a genitive
of quality 3 cf. 1. 369 cladem pericli (is that reading is correct).

202. vastae, ‘ waste ² or ‘ wasteful ’ : as taking up so much space
without producing anything in return.

204. inde porro, ‘secondly,' a pleonastic expression. duas
partes, Munro τὰ δύο μέρη, i.e. two-thirds are useless and un-
productive from being in the torricl or frigid zones: the habitable
zones being the temperate.

205. geli : this form of the genit. is common in Lucretius ; he also
has gelum acc. ·

casus: the frost falling from the sky, instead of rising rather
from the earth.

206. arvi ε partitive genit., ‘land fit for tilling and cultivation! ι

207. ni vie . . . Cf. Verg. Gemg. i. 198 722⁴ vis humana quotanms
. . . much of this passage is closely imitated in the second Georgz'c.

208. vitai : archaic genit.: see ll. 28, 67, 211.

bidenti: a heavy two-prenged hoe.

209. pressis . . . aratris ε so as to drive a deep furrow.

211. terrai: archaic genit. : as in l. 235. Cf. l. 208. . . .
