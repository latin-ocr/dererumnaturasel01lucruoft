LUCRETIUS V. 98—1 14

res nova miraque is the complement of accidat to which
exitium futurum is the subject.

98. aecidat: subj. of indirect question.

99. pervincere τ to carry my point in this matter.

100. ubi apportes: so Lucretius has cum videas, ubi videas.
The adverb ante goes with insolitam, ‘hitherto unexampled.'

101. visu: dative, contracted for visui.

102. indu: an archaism for in, cf. endo mari for in mari, vi. 890.
Cf. ἔνδον, l. 876 indupedita, l. 1227 we have induperator, i. 82
indugredi. In ii. 1096, we have this very phrase indu mame.
See L. Sc S. in init.

via . . . munita ε the highway or causeway of the Roman road
was often raised above the level of the land through which it
passed, therefore munire was a most appropriate word for building
a road. We trust the evidence of our senses of sight and touch
more readily than argument which our mind receives by the sense
of hearing. Duff quotes Hor. A. P. 180 segnius irritant animos
demissa per aurem, quam quae sunt oculis subiecta fidelibus. Cf.
Tennyson, Enoch Arden ‘Things seen are mightier than things
heard'.

103. templa, ‘the quarters’ of the mind are in the breast.
Lucretius also uses the phrase linguai templa, iv, 624, 1. 490-1
caeli templa, 1. 521 summania templa.

pectus : the seat of the intelligence‚ see note, l. 1.

104. dabit fidem: as we say ‘give evidence ’, see note,
l. 347. The subj. is much more common after forsitan: the indic.
is found in poets and post-Augustan prose-writers.

105. graviter ε take with conquassari.

107. flectat : see notes, 11. 77, 186. The optative use of the subj.

108. May reasoning rather than actual reality convince you of
the truth of these assertions.

110—234. Munro: ‘Here the argument is interrupted and it is
again taken up at 235’ ; it is therefore a later addition and is not
welded into the poem so as to form an organic whole; this indi-
cates that the poet left his work in an unfinished state.

110. Before I reveal the decrees of fate about the annihilation of
the world.

aggredior with infin. is chiefly poetical z so too l. 167.

111—12. These lines are repeated from i. 738—9. The Pythian
priestess sat on a tripod which was wreathed with myrtle garlands
as was also her brow. Ar. Plut. 39 τί δῆτα Φοῖβος ἔλακεν ἐκ τῶν
στεμμάτων ;

ratione, ‘ reasoning power!
tripode: in i. 739 tripodi is used.

113. doctis . . . dietis: notice the play on words. The same
phrase is found in Ennius, Plautus, and Vergil. Cf. note, l. 54.

114. Observe the strong r alliteration both initia] and in the
middle of the words.

ne . . . rearis: final as in l. 247: cf. ne . . . reamur, l. 78,
though ne with 2nd pers. pres. subj. is occasionally prohibitive.
