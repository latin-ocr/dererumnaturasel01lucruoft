LUCRETIUS V. 2 734) 1

275. quodcumque fluit . . .: according to Epicurus every sensa-
tion, every mental expression, is the result of touch or modified
touch. Exact images or fine films (simulacra, εἴδωλα) are thrown
off from the surface of solid objects (στερέμνια) and are perceived
by the soul-atoms in the bodily organs or by the mind itself. These
films move infinitely fast and incessantly flow off from bodies, yet
the bodies only diminish slowly‚ so fine are they. A mixture of
these films makes us believe we see centaurs, chimaeras, sirens,
sea-serpents‚ &c.

276. aeris . . . mare: so Enn. Trag. vi meli fretum. Shake-
speare‚ Timon iv. 2. 21 ‘ W'e must all part Into this sea of air '.
