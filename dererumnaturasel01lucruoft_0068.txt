LUCRETIUS V. 396-416

fuerit: subj. as regnam? in next line.

396. superavit et ardens : emendation for superavit el anzbens,
other edd. read superat et lambens, contracted perfect. Cf. i. 70
inritat animi, vi. 587 disturbat m‘bis.

397. avia, ‘ dashing wildly from the course ³ ; ἔξω δρόμου, with vis.

used for cases other than the nominative.

401. deturbavit equis, ‘ dashed, hurled down from his horses.'

cadenti obvius, ⁶ meeting him as he fell.’

402. aeternam lampada: as Duff says, Lucretius is trying to
prove the sun is not eternal. Consequently the epithet must be con-
sidered to be a stock one. Cf. l. 514 aeterni sidera mundi. See
note, l. 476.

ὃ succepit, ‘caught from him'3 i. e. in turn, almost = Greek
ιάδοχος.

404. sumn per iter gubernans, cuncta recreavit is the order.

suum does not refer to the subject of the sentence sol, but is
rather equivalent to proprium. Cf. Verg. Aen. vi. 232 Aeneas . . .
imponit suaque arma viro (i. e. arma Alz'senz') or Verg. Aen. vi. 152
sedibus hunc refer ante suis et conde sepulcrm Ov. Fast. ii. 678
slamato ‘ suns est ln'c ager, ille tuus ⁹.

405. scilicet : ironical ; for scire licet rather than sci (imperative)
licet. See Lindsay’s Sliort Historicczl Latin Grammar, p. 124.
Its meaning is equivalent to δηλονότι, ‘ you must know.'

Graium : for Graiorum.

made the waters to stand on an heap '.

412. ut fama est : as 1. 405 ut veteres Graium cecinere
poetae.

quando : temporal‚ not interrogative, in the days of Deucalion.
413. After ubi vis take l. 414, then aliqua . . . recessit.

415. constiterunt: cf. suerum, l. 474: the meaning is as in
Old Testament, Genesis viii. 3 ‘the waters were abated ².
