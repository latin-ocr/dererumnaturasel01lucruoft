LUCRETIUS V. 1 15-26

putes, l. 117, depends also on ne final.

religione: as in l. 86 first syllable long, see note to recidere,
1. 280. For Lucretius' view of religion cf. i. 101 tantum relzgio
potuit suadere malorum.

115. Half the line is connected by conjunctions, the other half is
asyndetic: cf. 11. 68, 75, 438—9.

116. Lucretius, in maintaining the theories of Epicurus, combats
the views of the Stoics, vis animae divina regit hoc opus, i.e. that
the whole universe is a spiritual force : one part is active, the soul,
a fiery ether which permeates everything‚ the other part is passive,
the elements‚ earth and water (contrast ll. 140- 5 below) The
universe itself 15 3 living force, God, whether he is Fire, Air, Spirit‚
Reason, Nature, LaW, Destiny or Necessity, and all the gods of
popular religion merely represent the various activities of the one
God, such as Demeter, Diony sus, Athene; they are only popular
conceptions of Zeus or the one God in his functions of giving
mortals corn, wine, olives. Moreover, the human soul emanates
from God, as the passive part of the universe proceeds from the
active part, and it outlives the body. From what we have already
seen in reading the foregoing 100 ylines and from the Introduction
Lucretius and othe Epicureans looked up on these views as rank
heresy, or rather as crass stupidity Thep Stoics also explained the
foolish or immoral stories of the gods found in the old poets as
allegories‚ which were intended to convey some moral or physical
truth, as in the next few lines all atheists or agnostics are put on
a level with the Giants who tried to conquer Heaven and subdue
the gods ε they were punished sor their impiety, a similar fate awaits
the impious disturbers of religion.

ritu: with genit. common in verse and prose. Notice the
alliteration ofp in these two lines.

117—21 are a parenthesis: the argument is resumed, 1. 122.

119. disturbent. .velint: subj. as being subordinate clauses
in oratio obliqua.

disturbent = distmbarer elz'nl. The Epicureans who deny
the immortality of the world are condemned to the fate of the
Giants m the opinion of the Stoics.

121. notantes, sc. zg'nomi'ma: the official brand of ignominy
affixed by the censor to a man’ s name. Lucretius means that the
Stoics consider the language of the Epicureans' in maintaining that
the world must perish as an impious blanding of immortal things
xxith mortal speech and judgement.

122. quae takes up the argument again from l.116.

usque adeo is to be taken with procul and repeated with z'ndzgna.

123. The order is que (usque adeo) i'ndzgnaz zdentzcr qnae smt in
numero deum: cf. l. 51.

124. notitiam, ‘a conception,' ‘ a general idea’ : notice the
marked p alliteration.

125. quid sit: Munro, i. e. quale sit illud quod est remotum,
‘ of the character of things not endowed with . . ’
